# Python Workout: 50 Ten-minute Exercises
This is my repo following the book "Python Workout: 50 Ten-minute Exercises" by Reuven M. Lerner 

Synopsis taken from the book:
"This book isn’t meant to teach you Python. Rather, it’s meant to give you the practice you need to achieve greater fluency. After going through the exercises in this book — not just skimming through the questions and peeking at the answers — you will write more readable, more idiomatic, and more maintainable Python code."
