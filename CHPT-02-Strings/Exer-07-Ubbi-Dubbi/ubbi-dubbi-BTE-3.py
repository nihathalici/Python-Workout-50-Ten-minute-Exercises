URL-encode characters—In URLs, we often replace special and nonprintable
characters with a % followed by the character’s ASCII value in hexadecimal. For
example, if a URL is to include a space character (ASCII 32, aka 0x20), we
replace it with %20. Given a string, URL-encode any character that isn’t a letter
or number. For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume that all characters
are indeed in ASCII (i.e., one byte long), and not multibyte UTF-8 characters. It
might help to know about the ord (http://mng.bz/EdnJ) and hex (http://mng
.bz/nPxg) functions.
