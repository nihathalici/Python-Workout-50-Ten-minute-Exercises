'''
Define a Bread class representing a loaf of bread. We should be able to invoke
a get_nutrition method on the object, passing an integer representing the number
of slices we want to eat. In return, weâ€™ll receive a dict whose key-value pairs
will represent calories, carbohydrates, sodium, sugar, and fat, indicating
the nutritional statistics for that number of slices. Now implement two new classes
that inherit from Bread, namely WholeWheatBread and RyeBread. Each class should
implement the same get_nutrition method, but with different nutritional
information where appropriate.
