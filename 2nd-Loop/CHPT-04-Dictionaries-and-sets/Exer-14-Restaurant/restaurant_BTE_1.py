'''
Create a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are passwords,
both represented as strings. Create a tiny login system, in which the user
must enter a username and password. If there is a match, then indicate
that the user has successfully logged in. If not, then refuse them entry.
(Note: This is a nice little exercise, but please never store unencrypted
passwords. Itâ€™s a major security risk.)'''
