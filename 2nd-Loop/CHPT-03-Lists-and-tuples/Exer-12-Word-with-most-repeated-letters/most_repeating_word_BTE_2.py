Write a program to read /etc/passwd on a Unix computer. The first field
contains the username, and the final field contains the userâ€™s shell,
the command interpreter. Display the shells in decreasing order of popularity,
such that the most popular shell is shown first, the second most popular
shell second, and so forth.
