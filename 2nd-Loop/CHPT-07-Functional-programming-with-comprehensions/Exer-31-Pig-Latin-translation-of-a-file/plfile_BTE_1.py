In this exercise, plfile applied the plword function to every word in a file.
Write a new function, funcfile, that will take two argumentsâ€”a filename and
a function. The output from the function should be a string, the result of
invoking the function on each word in the text file. You can think of this
as a generic version of plfile, one that can return any string value.

    return word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'

    return ' '.join(plword(one_word)
