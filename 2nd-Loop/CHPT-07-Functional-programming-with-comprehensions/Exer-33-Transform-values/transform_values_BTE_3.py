'''
Write a function that takes a directory name (i.e., a string) as an argument.
The function should return a dict in which the keys are the names of files
in that directory, and the values are the file sizes. You can use os.listdir
or glob.glob to get the files, but because only regular files have sizes,
youâ€™ll want to filter the results using methods from os.path. To determine
the file size, you can use os.stat or (if you prefer) just check the length
of the string resulting from reading the file.

from pathlib import Path

def tr_vl_dir(a_path):
    di = {}
    values = Path(a_path)
    return {item.name : item.stat().st_size
            for item in values.iterdir()
            if item.is_file()}

print(tr_vl_dir('.'))
