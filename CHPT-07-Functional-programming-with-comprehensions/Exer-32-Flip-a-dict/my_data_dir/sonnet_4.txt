O thou, my 1 lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time’s fickle 2 glass, his sickle, hour;
Who hast by 3 waning grown, and therein show’st
Thy lovers 4 withering as thy sweet self grow’st;
If Nature, 5 sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest 6 onwards, still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to 7 this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace and 8 wretched minutes kill.
Yet fear her, O thou minion 9 of her pleasure!
She may detain, but not still 10 keep, her treasure:
Her audit, though delay’d, answer’d 11 must be
And her quietus is to render 12 thee.
