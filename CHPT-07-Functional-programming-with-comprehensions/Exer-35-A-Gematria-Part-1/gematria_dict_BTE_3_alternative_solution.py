Itâ€™s sometimes useful to transform data from one format into another. Download a JSON-formatted
list of the 1,000 largest cities in the United States from http://mng.bz/Vgd0. Using a dict
comprehension, turn it into a dict in which the keys are the city names, and the values are
the populations of those cities. Why are there only 925 key-value pairs in this dict? Now
create a new dict, but set each key to be a tuple containing the state and city. Does that
ensure there will be 1,000 key-value pairs?
